# lein-kinesis

A Leiningen plugin to run an in-memory instance of Amazon's kinesis using Michael Hart's [kinesalite](https://github.com/mhart/kinesalite).

## Usage

Add `[lein-kinesis "0.1.0"]` to the `:plugins` vector of your project.

Start the kinesis service when running lein by specifying it before the other tasks that you are running, for example:

    $ lein kinesis run

Once the task completes, the kinesalite service will also be terminated.

If for some reason you'd like to run the plugin by itself you can invoke it like this, with any further tasks:

    $ lein kinesis
    
When you want to stop it just press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.
   
## Configuration

There are optional pieces of configuration that control how the plugin operates:

```clojure
(defproject my-project "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"
  ...
  :plugins [[lein-kinesis "0.1.0"]]
  ...
  :kinesis {:port 12345 ; optional - port on which the service listens, default value is 8023
            :ssl ; optional - whether ssl is used or not, default value is false
            }
  ...
)
```
